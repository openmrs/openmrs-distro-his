**OpenMRS HIS** is an enhanced distribution of OpenMRS, **powered by Ozone**, that extends the platform beyond its EMR capabilities to deliver a full **Health Information System (HIS)**.

While OpenMRS lays the groundwork for patient data management and medical record keeping, OpenMRS HIS brings much more by integrating complementary applications: **Odoo for ERP (billing, stock, pharmacy)**, **OpenELIS Global for laboratory management**, and **Ozone Analytics for real-time reporting**; all unified and secured through **SSO** and aligned with the **OpenHIE Product Catalog specification**.

It is also **white-labeled and ready to be rebranded**, with examples already implemented for Odoo and Keycloak matching the OpenMRS style.

The result is a ready-to-use, modular, and scalable HIS that builds on the strengths of OpenMRS while meeting the broader needs of health facilities and national health programs.
